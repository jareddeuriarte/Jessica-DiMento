                    Pools documents the varying aquatic landscapes through the land locked mid and west Tennessee areas.
                    Through
                    a
                    variety of indoor and outdoor leisure pools, underwater scenes, competitive aquatic club bubble
                    structures,
                    and
                    hotels, captures the essence of those who inhabit such spaces as well as details within them.
                    Oftentimes
                    through
                    symmetry are candid children and families playing, old folks exercising, a competitive swim team at
                    work,
                    and
                    also a friend submerged underwater. In addition, the emotions some may feel regarding the
                    vulnerability
                    some
                    may
                    feel in swim suits, the confidence after a race, or the bliss of splashing with others. Pools are
                    spaces
                    that
                    can be shared by all ages as swimming is a lifetime sport and activity, while simultaneously
                    allowing
                    for
                    the
                    option to a very individual experience.
