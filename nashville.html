                <h2>Jefferson Street Barbershops</h2>



                <p>

                    In North Nashville lies historic Jefferson Street home to Tennessee State University, and fourteen
                    barbershops scattered along it as you make your way down. It is located in a predominantly African
                    American neighborhood and is home to Nashville's R&B scene. In addition, the street played a huge
                    role in the Civil War. Today, you can find groups of kids playing on the sidewalk, regulars at bus
                    stops and depending on the day, food trucks with fried okra and people gathered around cooking out.
                    <br><br>

                    I used to live near Jefferson Street, always passing the 14 Barbershops hosted there in as I drove
                    by. I wanted to have a closer look at this street to really understand how special it is to
                    Nashville. Nashville Barbershops is a body of work that is my way of navigating a more close up view
                    and discovering its community. Its purpose it to preserve, and give dignity to the individuals I
                    would see as I drove by.



                    <br><br>

                    Growing up as an only girl, I would frequent barbershops with my dad and brothers on errand runs.
                    Those intimate memories drew me in to this community. As I frequented Showtime, along with others on
                    the block I would oftentimes bump into the same regulars in ways I might at my University. As I
                    connected with barbers like Chris from Showtime, and my own nostalgia of revisiting my childhood
                    routines, I got to develop friendships with those I never thought I could.
